Credit goes to Blazer for his original FE7 All-Instrument Hack,
on which this patch was based.

To use this patch, assemble your song in the new voicegroup.

FireRed/Ruby:  0xB30C5C
Emerald: 0x1130C5C

All instruments with the exception of the drums correspond with normal MIDI/Sappy numbers.
The regular drumkit is instrument 127, replacing the Gunshot.
Another drum, representing the D#5 note in drum tracks, is instrument 126, replacing Applause.

The Gunshot and Applause Intruments remain in the patch.
If you wish to use them, go to 'Edit Voicegroup' in Sappy, choose the instruments you wish to replace,
and input the following:

FireRed/Ruby

Applause (Direct Sound): 0xA15074, Atk: 255 Dec: 0 Sus: 255 Rel: 235
