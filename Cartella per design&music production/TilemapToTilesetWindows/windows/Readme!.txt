	   >----Explanation----<
The program itself is pretty self explanatory,

before you can start tiling your image, you need
to select an input image and an output folder.

You also have to choose a compatible tile width an height,
so your image has to be divisible by your tile dimensions, for example: 
This works: 128px X 256px | width: 16px height: 32px
This doesn't: 128px X 256px | width: 11px height: 19px

With the printing mode switch, you can choose if you either want,
every tile as an image or if you want one single tileset

Then just press start!

	      >----Todo----<
1. A spacing setting that lets you choose a spacing between every tile,
   so that you could have a 1px thick grid

2. Isometric Mode that prints out isometric tiles



I am very thankful for all your feedback and suggestions!
